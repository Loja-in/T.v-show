                    <h2>what's the series about?</h2>
                    <p>House M.D. is a medical drama series that follows the life of Dr. Gregory House, a brilliant but misanthropic
                    diagnostician who specializes in solving puzzling medical cases that other doctors find difficult to diagnose. He leads
                    a team of doctors at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital and often clashes with his colleagues due to his
                    unconventional methods and abrasive personality. The series explores medical mysteries, ethical dilemmas, and the
                    complex personal lives of its characters.
